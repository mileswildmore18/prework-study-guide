# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide with information of understanding how functions work within developing a webpage. It will contain notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript
This will help everyone get to know about what web developing is all about and how it can be used in the real world.
I built this project to help others who are just starting to learn about web developing and to give them a headstart what common terms will be used in the course.
This will help give people the knowledge of what they will be using while developing their own webpage.
I learned about how these terms in the study guide can help me with everyday life working on webpages I have been working on.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used to help you understand terminology in specific areas of web developing as you create a webpage. It contains notes about certain topics, including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the Chrome DevTools via Google Chrome by pressing Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (macOS), you can see the JavaScript functioning in the background. It lists the topics what I learned from prework and chooses one topic for you to study first.
